## ✅ Progress Made So Far

- Raw data exploration – understanding the dataset structure.
- Data cleaning and visualization (handling missing values, basic plots).
- Applied **PCA** to both normalized and cleaned raw data.
- Created plots in **MATLAB** including:
  - Box plots  
  - Scatter plots  
  - 3D scatter plots (`scatter3`)

## 🔄 Current Work in Progress

- Applying **CCA**, **PCA**, and feature engineering techniques.
- Continuing analysis and refining visualizations.

## 📅 Project Deadlines

- **Project Proposal**: 1st April 2025  
- **Presentation 1**: Week 8  
- **Presentation 2**: Week 10  
- **Final Presentation**: Week 12

## 🧠 Research Notes

> Currently exploring machine learning techniques, focusing on **supervised learning models**.  
> One paper utilized a **Siamese Neural Network** for fault detection.  
> Another compared models such as **GPR**, **SVM**, and **ANN**.  
> Among them, **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)** was the most efficient—handling large data sets and showing decreased error with more training data (evaluated using **RMSE**).
