This is the first blog post regarding the **EE461 project**. The project is called "Fault detection in PEMFCs using data driven techniques".  
* The project will emphasize using MATLAB. 
* Main goal is to develop a model that can detect faults in PEM fuel cells based on sensor data.

For this project the dataset used is given in the following website, https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/dataset/Data_for_fault_diagnosis_of_practical_polymer_electrolyte_membrane_PEM_fuel_cell_system_with_data-driven_approaches_/4009959
The following are some of resources linked to the dataset: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775319313874 (Research Paper) and https://youtu.be/hLdzHWdiHu8?si=bpMMbwy03omKsxM4 (Paper discussion).

## Progress made so far
* Raw data exploration - understanding the data.
* Data exploration techniques - Cleaning data, filling missing data and making generic plots to visualise the data.
* Applying PCA to the normalized and raw data (cleaned).
* Making plots in MATLAB such as box plots, scatter plots and scatter3 plots to name a few.

## Continuation (currently working on this)
* application of CCA, PCA and feature engineering extraction.

_Notes_
> Currently have researched on the Machine learning techniques, aiming for supervised learning model. One paper used Siamese Neural Network in fault detection. 
> Another paper used models such as GPR, SVM and ANN. Based on this the most efficient model was the GPR where it was able to handle larger sets of the data. The validation was conducted using RSME where GPR showed decrease in error when the training data increased.
