## PCA Reduced Dataset

A PCA reduced dataset refers to a dataset that has been transformed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce its dimensionality while preserving as much of the original data's variance as possible. It identifies the most important patterns in the dataset and redue the number of features (dimensions) while retraining the most critical information. 

Train data is the part of the dataset used to train the machine learning model, it refers to the training portion of a dataset that has been transformed using PCA  to reduce its dimensionality before training a ML model. The below section contains the best three models for the trained PCA:
